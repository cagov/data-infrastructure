#X-Small: Good for small tasks and experimenting.
#Small: Suitable for single-user workloads and development.
#Medium: Handles moderate concurrency and data volumes.
#Large: Manages larger queries and higher concurrency.
#X-Large: Powerful for demanding workloads and data-intensive operations.
#2X-Large: Double the capacity of X-Large.
#3X-Large: Triple the capacity of X-Large.
#4X-Large: Quadruple the capacity of X-Large.
