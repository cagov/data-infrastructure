# MDSA Training

This details a possible training path for participants in the Modern Data Stack Accelerator.
Not all participants necessarily need every module in the path,
but data engineers and data analysts should ensure that they are familiar with the content here.

## GitHub

**Goals of training**

* Become familiar with a branching style of code development.
* Become familiar with GitHub's user interface for issues, pull requests, code review, and continuous integration.

**Who should go through this?** Data engineers and data analysts in the MDSA project will do a lot of work in GitHub.
Non-coding project participants should also become familiar with GitHub's user interface,
and have a understanding of how to write issues and use Markdown.

### 1. Set up a GitHub account

If you already have an account, great!
If not, go ahead and set one up by going to [GitHub's pricing page](https://github.com/pricing)
and selecting the option for a free account. Then:

1. Enter a username
1. Enter your email (we suggest work email, you can associate other emails later if you like)
1. Enter a password
1. Verify that you're human by solving a puzzle
1. Click create account
1. An email will be sent to you for verification. Verify your email following those instructions

You'll use this account or one you already have to participate in the modern data stack accelerator.

### 3. Read GitHub's [guide to git](https://github.com/git-guides/)

This is a good introduction to the mechanics of git (separate from GitHub as a code hosting platform).
A large amount of development happens locally on your machine,
and being fluent with concepts like cloning, pushing, pulling, and committing
will make everything that follows much easier.

### 3. Go through the [introduction to GitHub tutorial](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github).

This should take about an hour, and should be taken by all data engineers and data analysts on the project.
You will learn how to create a branch, commit a change, open a pull request, and merge your change.

### 4. Learn how to [author GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.com/skills/communicate-using-markdown)

This should take about an hour, and involves no code.
It is useful for many project members to learn this material,
including those who are not doing day-to-day coding,
as it is used in issue tracking, cross referencing, and other project-management tooling.

### 5. Learn how to [review pull requests on GitHub](https://github.com/skills/review-pull-requests)

This should take about an hour, and should be taken by all data engineers and data analysts on the project.
You will learn how to open pull requests, review them, suggest changes, and merge them.
Any change to the project codebase should go through this process,
as it allows for peer review, automated checks and tests (CI), and automated deployments (CD).

## Snowflake

**Goals of training**

* Understand what Snowflake is, and how cloud data warehouses differ from traditional on-prem OLTP databases.
* Become familiar with Snowflake terminology (warehouse, database, role etc).
* Have a basic understanding of how to use the Snowflake user interface.

**Who should go through this?**
Data engineers should go through this training,

### 1. Take Snowflake's [Data Warehousing Workshop](https://learn.snowflake.com/en/courses/uni-essdww101/)

This covers the fundamentals of the Snowflake Data Warehouse.
It should take 6-8 hours.

### 2. Tour your Snowflake warehouse


## dbt

**Goals of training**

* Become familiar with building data models in dbt
* Learn how to go through a GitHub based branching workflow with dbt

**Who should go through this?**
Data engineers and data analysts should go through this training,
as it represents the core workflow for transforming raw datasets into reporting-ready models.

### 1. Take the [dbt fundamentals](https://courses.getdbt.com/courses/fundamentals) course.

### 2.
