# MDSA Training

This details a possible training path for participants in the Modern Data Stack Accelerator.

## GitHub

**Goals of training**

* Become familiar with a branching style of code development.
* Become familiar with GitHub's user interface for issues, pull requests, code review, and continuous integration.

**Who should go through this?** Data engineers and data analysts in the MDSA project will do a lot of work in GitHub.
Non-coding project participants should also become familiar with GitHub's user interface,
and have a understanding of how to write issues and use Markdown.

### 1. Set up a GitHub account

If you already have an account, great!
If not, go ahead and set one up by going to [GitHub's pricing page](https://github.com/pricing)
and selecting the option for a free account. Then:

1. Enter a username
1. Enter your email (we suggest work email, you can associate other emails later if you like)
1. Enter a password
1. Verify that you're human by solving a puzzle
1. Click create account
1. An email will be sent to you for verification. Verify your email following those instructions

You'll use this account or one you already have to participate in the modern data stack accelerator.

### 2. Go through the ["Introduction to GitHub" tutorial](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github).

This should take about an hour.
You will learn how to create a branch, commit a change, open a pull request, and merge your change.

### 3. Learn how to [author GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.com/skills/communicate-using-markdown)

This should take about an hour, and involves no code.
It is useful for many project members to learn this material,
including those who are not doing day-to-day coding,
as it is used in issue tracking, cross referencing, and other project-management tooling.
