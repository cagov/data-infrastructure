# git and GitHub

## What are git and GitHub?

Git and GitHub occupy central positions in modern software development practices.

Git is software that you install locally on your machine that enables source code management (SCM).
Code is organized into folder-like structures called git repositories,
which enables you to track the history of code,
safely develop features in side branches,
and collaborate with others in a distributed fashion.

GitHub is a web platform for hosting git repositories.
It integrates tightly with local git development workflows,
and includes additional features like a code review user interface,
issue tracking, project boards,
[continuous integration/continuous delivery](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles/continuous-integration-vs-delivery-vs-deployment),
and social networking.
There are a number of web platforms which have similar features and goals as GitHub
(including Bitbucket and GitLab), but GitHub is the most commonly used.

## Learning git

There are many high-quality resources for learning git online. Here are a few:

* Atlassian has an excellent set of tutorials for learning git, including:
    * [A conceptual overview for beginners](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)
    * [How to set up a repository](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository)
    * [How to use git to collaborate with others](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing)
* GitHub has a nice [cheat-sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) for common git commands
* The [official git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) is not always the most user-friendly, but it has a depth of information that isn't available elsewhere

## Learning GitHub

In addition to the fundamentals of git,
it's also helpful to know how to use the GitHub web platform for development.
GitHub hosts an excellent set of [interactive tutorials](https://skills.github.com/)
for learning to use its various features, including:

* [An introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github)
* [How to use Markdown for issues and READMEs](https://github.com/skills/communicate-using-markdown)
* [How to review pull requests](https://github.com/skills/review-pull-requests)
* [How to automate tasks and use CI/CD with GitHub actions](https://github.com/skills/hello-github-actions)

## git and GitHub at CalData

On the CalData Data Services and Engineering team we make heavy use of git and GitHub for our projects,
and have our own set of [guidelines and best practices](../code/code-review.md) for code review.
