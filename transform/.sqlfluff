# Probably a controversial exclusion, so adding some justification here:
# This disables the rule that prevents unreserved keywords from being
# used as column aliases. The rule is intended to prevent accidental shadowing
# of SQL keywords, which, honestly, sounds like a good idea! **However**,
# this can result in some awkward contortions in final dataset column names,
# which are intended for end users who shouldn't care about our query language
# limitations. Since SQL tends to have quite a long list of keywords, the
# restriction actually prevents some quite natural column names, preventing
# legibility for end users (e.g., date, timestamp, name).
