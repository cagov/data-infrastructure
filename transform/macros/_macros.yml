macros:
  - name: spatial_join_with_deduplication
    description: |
      Macro to perform a spatial join between two relations with deduplication of the
      geometries in the left table. For all left geometries that satisfy the predicate
      for more than one geometry in the right table, we compute their intersection and
      then choose the left geometry with the greatest intersection.
    arguments:
      - name: left_model
        type: string
        description: The left model to join. Can be a relation or CTE.
      - name: right_model
        type: string
        description: The right model to join. Can be a relation or CTE.
      - name: left_cols
        type: list of strings
        description: |
          List columns to keep from the left table
          (excluding the geometry column, which is always retained)
      - name: right_cols
        type: list of strings
        description: |
          List of columns to keep from the right table
          (excluding the geometry column, which is never retained).
          Cannot share any names with left_cols
      - name: left_geom
        type: string
        description: The name of the left geometry column, defaults to "geometry"
      - name: right_geom
        type: string
        description: The name of the right geometry column, defaults to "geometry"
      - name: op
        description: |
          The spatial predicate function to choose,
          defaults to "st_intersects"
      - name: kind
        type: string
        description: The kind of join, either "left" or "inner". Defaults to "left"
      - name: prefix
        type: string
        description: |
          An optional prefix to give to temporary CTEs to improve legibility and
          avoid name collisions.
