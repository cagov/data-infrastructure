          The lowest-order census defined statistical area. It is an area,
          such as a city block, bounded primarily by physical features but
          sometimes by invisible city or property boundaries. A tabulation
          block boundary does not cross the boundary of any other geographic
          area for which the Census Bureau tabulates data. The subtypes of
          this feature are Count Question Resolution (CQR), current, and
          tabulation census.
